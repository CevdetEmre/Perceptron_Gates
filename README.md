# Perceptron_Gates
Implement perceptron algorithm for logic gates


The Perceptron algorithm is considered to be the simplest type of Artificial Neural Network and one can use it as the starting point in ANN.
Perceptrons can deal with n number of inputs and produces a binary output exclusively.

Letâ€™s see the problem in hand which is a classic example to explain the working of the Perceptron algorithm.

Here, we implement the OR Logic Gate using the Perceptron algorithm which is classifying the 2 binary values into 0 or 1.

The computational graph of our perceptron is:
